## Description

A horror game I made for [SCREAM JAM 2024](https://itch.io/jam/scream-jam-2024) using Unity.

## Top Tier Reviews

> The idea is really good, easy to understand and fun to play. Almost died in reality because of the skeletons.. cool screamers) Needed three tries to win, so I'd say it has nice difficulty level: you need a couple of tries to figure out how to plan your path better. Nice work! - Mora 4

> Proof that you don't need industrial amounts of assets for a enjoyable and tense game. - ApeHardware
